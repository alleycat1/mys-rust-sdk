# MySocial Sdk

A rust Sdk for integrating with the [MySocial blockchain](https://docs.mso.io/).

> [!NOTE]
> This is project is under development and many features may still be under
> development or missing.

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of libraries for integrating with the MySocial blockchain.

A few of the project's high-level goals are as follows:

* **Be modular** - user's should only need to pay the cost (in terms of dependencies/compilation time) for the features that they use.
* **Be light** - strive to have a minimal dependency footprint.
* **Support developers** - provide all needed types, abstractions and APIs to enable developers to build robust applications on MySocial.
* **Support wasm** - where possible, libraries should be usable in wasm environments.

## Crates

In an effort to be modular, functionality is split between a number of crates.
